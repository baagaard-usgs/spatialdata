# Development Plan

## Version 3.0.0dev

List of new features currently available in the `main` branch.

* Convert to Python 3
* Change `label` in `SpatialDB` and `TimeHistory` to `description` to avoid confusion with other Pyre properties called `label`.
* Create online documentation for Spatial Data that is now separate from PyLith.
  * Documentation covers more features and use cases.
  * Examples include C++, Python, and `cfg` files.
