2010/06/08 (version 0.6.0)

  Permit nondimensionl values in spatial databases.


2009/07/06 (version 0.5.2)

  Added --enable-swig configure argument because source distribution
  already contains the SWIG generated files (use --enable-swig when
  using the source repository).

2009/07/01 (version 0.5.1)

  Fixed trapping of errors from Python when using units parser.

2009/06/19 (version 0.5.0)

  Switched to SWIG for Python modules. Added parsing of units in
  SimpleDB headers. Added time history files.

2007/02/26

  Switched to using numpy arrays as arguments in Python
  SimpleIOAscii::write(). This greatly simplifies creating a database
  from Python. Simplified GenSimpleDBApp so that it is all Python.

2007/01/01

  Changed interface so that it no longer uses pointers to pointers
  when passing arrays as arugments. You now pass just a pointer to
  where the values are to be stored. This makes the user interface
  cleaner.

  Numpy version >= 1.0 is now required (previous changeset).

2007/01/07

  Changed interfaces to allow spatial dimension of coordinate systems
  to be 1-D and 2-D instead of just 3-D.
