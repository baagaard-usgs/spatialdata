  Changed interface so that it no longer uses pointers to pointers
  when passing arrays as arugments. You now pass just a pointer to
  where the values are to be stored. This makes the user interface
  cleaner.

  Numpy version >= 1.0 is now required (previous changeset).

  Changed interfaces to allow spatial dimension of coordinate systems
  to be 1-D and 2-D instead of just 3-D.
